## Customization

### Changing Theme Colors

Edit the `src/utils/theme.js` file to modify the theme colors:

```javascript
export const theme = {
  themeColor1: '#4CAF50', // Green - for buttons, highlighted text
  themeColor2: '#2196F3', // Blue - for secondary elements
  themeColor3: '#2a2a2a', // Dark gray - background color
  // ... rest of the theme
};
```

### Adding More Category Colors

You can add more colors to the `categoryColors` array in the same file:

```javascript
categoryColors: [
  '#FF6B6B', // Red
  '#4ECDC4', // Teal
  // ... add more colors here
]
```

## Data Storage

All data is stored in the browser's localStorage with the following keys:
- `timer_categories`: Category information
- `timer_sessions`: Completed timer sessions
- `active_timers`: Currently running timers

## Browser Compatibility

This application works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- localStorage API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- React 18

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Timers not persisting after refresh**
   - Make sure localStorage is enabled in your browser
   - Check that you're not in incognito/private browsing mode

2. **Charts not displaying**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
   - Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors

3. **Python server not starting**
   - Make sure Python 3 is installed and in your PATH
   - Try running `python3 server.py` instead of `python server.py`

### Data Backup

To backup your data, you can export the localStorage data:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Find localStorage for your domain
4. Copy the values for the timer-related keys
